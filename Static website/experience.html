                        <h1>I. Introduction</h1>
                        <p>The software engineering group project was a valuable learning experience for the team. 
                            In this retrospective, we will reflect on various aspects of the project, including communication, role assignments, and iteration planning. 
                            We will also discuss how our team's velocity changed over time and its impact on iteration planning.
                            Finally, we will reflect on what we would do differently if we had the chance to start the project again<br>
                        </p>
                        <h1>II. Communication</h1>
                        <h3>What went wrong and right in development</h3>
                        <p>
                            At the start of the project, our team had weak communication, which affected our progress. We were not clear about each other's roles 
                            and responsibilities, which led to confusion and delays. However, as we progressed through the project, we communicated more effectively. 
                            We scheduled regular meetings to discuss our progress and any issues that arose. We also used collaboration tools such as Telegram and Discord 
                            to keep track of our tasks and deadlines. Overall, our communication improved significantly over time, which helped us to work more efficiently.
                        </p>
                        <h1>III. Iteration Planning</h1>
                        <h3>What would we do differently, if we had the chance to start over?</h3>
                        <p>
                            At the beginning of the project, our team assigned roles for each iteration without first discussing our individual strengths and weaknesses. 
                            In hindsight, we realized that it would have been more effective to establish each team member's skills and experience before assigning roles 
                            for the entire project. By doing so, we could have assigned more substantial roles that played to each team member's strengths, rather than 
                            dividing tasks on a per-iteration basis. This approach would have allowed us to work more efficiently and deliver a higher-quality product. 
                        </p>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <div class="about_img"><img src="images/experience.jpeg"></div>
                    <div>
                        <h1>IV. Changes in velocity</h1>
                        <h3>Are we using any specific techniques covered in the course (TDD, pair programming, scrums, etc)?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our team's velocity changed significantly over time. Initially, we struggled to meet our targets, which affected our iteration planning. 
                            However, as we improved our communication and became more familiar with the project, our velocity increased. We were able to complete tasks 
                            more efficiently, which allowed us to plan our iterations more effectively. We also recognized the importance of adjusting our iteration plans 
                            as necessary to accommodate any changes in our velocity.
                        </p>
                        <h1>V. Conclusion</h1>
                        <p>
                            Overall, our software engineering group project was a valuable learning experience for our team. We learned the importance of effective 
                            communication, role assignments, and iteration planning. If we had the chance to start the project over again, we would have placed more 
                            emphasis on communication from the start. We would also have tried to establish clearer and more specific goals to help us focus our efforts. 
                            Additionally, we would have paid closer attention to our velocity and adjusted our iteration plans accordingly.
